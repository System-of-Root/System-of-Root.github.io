        <h3>Melon Loader</h3>
        <p>Mods for Arrow a Row use the <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">Melon Mod Loader</a> v0.5.7 The installer for that can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe">MelonLoader.Installer.exe</a></p>
        <p>Before installing the loader, You will need to make a copy of the game files. This is because the game's default installation path is incompatible with Melon.
            Start by secondary-clicking <i>(Right-click on most computers)</i> on the game in Steam and selecting Manage > Browse local files.</p>

        <p>This should open File Explorer to a path similar to <i>"SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\箭箭剑 Arrow a Row."</i> You need to back out to the "common" folder and copy the game's install folder somewhere <i>(it does not really matter where.)</i> 
            Rename the copy to something that does not have non-English characters in it. For example, "Modded Arrow A Row"</p>   
        <p>The game is now ready to have the mod loader installed. Open the installer you downloaded and click the SELECT button. Navigate to where you copied the game, and select <i>"Arrow a Row.exe,"</i>
            uncheck the Latest check box, select version 0.5.7, and click install. Your settings should look like this:

        <h3>Installing Mods</h3>
        <p>The installer should have created a <i>"Mods"</i> folder inside of the game's folder. Mods are installed into this folder. 
            To install a mod, copy all included files into the Mods folder <b>Note: it is essential that the mod files sit directly inside that folder and not in a sub-folder.</b></p>
        <p>Once all the mods you wish to play with are installed, open the Arrow a Row.exe. If you have done everything correctly, you should see a small console open, then MelonLoader launching the game proper.</p>
