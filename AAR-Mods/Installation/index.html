        <h1><b>Installing Mods for Arrow a Row</b></h1>  
        <hr>
        <h3>Mellon Loader</h3>
        <p>Mods for Arrow a Row use the <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">Melon Mod Loader</a> v0.5.7 The installer for that can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe">MelonLoader.Installer.exe</a></p>
        <p>Before we install the loader however, we need to make a copy of the game files. This is because the default Installation path for the game is incompatible with Mellon.
            Start by secondary-clicking <i>(Right click on most computers)</i> on the game in steam and selecting Manage > Browse local files.</p>
        <img src="Steam- Loacal game files.png">
        <p>This should open file explorer to a path similar to <i>"SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\箭箭剑 Arrow a Row"</i> you need to back out to the "common" folder and copy the game's install folder somewhere <i>(it dose not really matter where.)</i> 
            Then rename the copy to something that dose not have non-english characters in it. For example "Modded Arrow A Row"</p>   
        <p>We are now ready to install the mod loader. Open the installer you downloaded and click the SELECT button. Then navigate to where you copied the game to, and select <i>"Arrow a Row.exe"</i>
            then uncheck the Latest check box and select version 0.5.7 and click install. Your settings should look like this:

        <h3>Installing Mods</h3>
        <p>The installer should have created a <i>"Mods"</i> folder inside of the game's folder. This is where you will install all of your mods. 
            To do this, simply copy the mod files into that folder. <b>Note: It is important that the mode files sit directly inside that folder and not in a sub folder</b></p>
        <p>Once all of the mods you wish to play with are installed, simply open the Arrow a Row.exe if you have done everything correctly you should see a small console open and then MelonLoader lunching the game proper.</p>
